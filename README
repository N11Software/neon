NEON - a new version control system
===================================
NEON is a version control that is used at Null.

Features:
- All Git Features are supported
- Does not merge branches when you push a commit before pulling a different file.
  ( this used to really annoy me so I will try to fix this :-) )
- Easily change repository settings remotely (through shell or desktop application)
- Out-of-the-box web dashboard
- Built-in CI (uses remote machines to run / also supports community made CI's)
- Community Plugins
